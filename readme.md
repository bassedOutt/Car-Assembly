# Multithreaded Car Assembly Application
This repository contains a JavaFX application that demonstrates proficiency in multithreaded and concurrent programming concepts. The application simulates a car assembly line, featuring both consumer threads responsible for assembling cars and producer threads responsible for producing car parts.
## Project Description
The Multithreaded Car Assembly Application is designed to showcase the practical implementation of multithreaded and concurrent programming techniques. It involves the interaction between consumer and producer threads to simulate the assembly of cars using various car parts such as body, engine, and accessories.
## Features
- Creation and management of consumer threads responsible for assembling cars.
- Creation and management of producer threads responsible for producing car parts (body, engine, accessory).
- User interface for controlling the speed of individual producers and the consumer.
- Real-time visualization of the assembly process using JavaFX graphical components.

## Usage
To build and run the application, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository <br>
``git clone https://github.com/your-username/multithreaded-car-assembly.git``
2. Build the project ``mvn clean package``
3. Run the application ``mvn javafx: run``
